LangChain is an open source orchestration framework for application development using large language models (LLMs). Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and AI agents. 
LangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.
